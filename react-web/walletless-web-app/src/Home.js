        <p>
            Walletless is a consumer-friendly app that enables users and healthcare providers
            to access stored information in a secure, convenient, accurate and timely manner.
            Users have immediate and easy access to a cyber wallet containing documents,
            insurance cards, and information that would normally be placed in wallets.
            Ultimately, additional information can be stored limited only by the imagination
            of the consumer. Healthcare providers with consent from their patients can
            access authorized, accurate information and documents from the patient and,
            thereby, reduce one of its biggest problems of incomplete and inaccurate
            information. Walletless will also facilitate streamlined communication between
            healthcare providers, patients and insurance companies. The app will provide an
            unparalled retention and marketing tool for healthcare providers. Walletless is
            the opportunity to get an edge in the new consumer driven healthcare market.
